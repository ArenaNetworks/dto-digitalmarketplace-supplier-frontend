        We will now review your information to ensure you’re suitable to become a registered seller in the Digital Marketplace.

        We will send you an email to let you know once your profile is live.      </p>
        <h2>While you wait</h2>

        <p>We recommend reading the Digital Marketplace <a href="/sellers-guide" target="_blank" rel="external">seller guide</a>.</p>
        <p>It explains:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>why you need to express interest in opportunities early</li>
          <li>how to offer new services</li>
          <li>the assessment process</li>

          <p>An initial assessment is underway, your updated profile will be published to the seller catalogue once a member of our team has approved your update.</p>
          <h2>What happens now</h2>

          <p>Once your updated profile is published you’ll be able to continue to apply for opportunities as normal for your current areas
            of expertise. If a digital professional opportunity requires an area of expertise you’re not yet assessed for you’ll need to
            express interest in the opportunity to request an assessment.</p>
          <p>We recommend reading our <a href="/sellers-guide" target="_blank" rel="external">seller guide</a>.</p>
          <p>It explains:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to add new services</li>
            <li>What to expect during assessments</li>
            <li>Why you need to express interest in an opportunity at least 3 days before it closes, if it requires an area of expertise you’ve not yet been assessed for.</li>
