        We will now review your information to ensure you’re suitable to become a registered seller in the Digital Marketplace.

        We will send you an email to let you know once your profile is live.      </p>
        <h2>While you wait</h2>

        <p>We recommend reading the Digital Marketplace <a href="/sellers-guide" target="_blank" rel="external">seller guide</a>.</p>
        <p>It explains:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>why you need to express interest in opportunities early</li>
          <li>how to offer new services</li>
          <li>the assessment process</li>
        </ul>

          <p>We will review your profile updates to ensure the new content is suitable for the Digital Marketplace. We will send you an email to let you know once your updated profile is live.</p>
          <p>An assessment will be triggered when you apply for an opportunity that needs expertise you’re not yet approved to offer. If we can confirm your expertise before the opportunity closes we will invite you to apply.</p>
          <p>You can apply for opportunities you’ve been successfully assessed for in future without the need for further assessment.</p>
        {% else %}
          <p>Your updated business profile will appear in the seller catalogue as soon as our team has reviewed it. We will send you an email to let you know when it goes live. </p>
          <h2>What happens now</h2>

          You can continue to apply for opportunities as normal. We also recommend reading our <a href="/sellers-guide" target="_blank" rel="external">seller guide</a>.</p>
          <p>It explains:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to add new services</li>
            <li>What to expect during assessments</li>
            <li>Why you need to express an interest in an opportunity at least 3 days before it closes, if it requires a service you've not yet been assessed for. </li>
          </ul>
