                    It was published before we completed the transition to the updated Digital Marketplace. <br/>

                    And so it's available to our original sellers only. <br/>

                    You will be able to apply for opportunities from now on if you have the expertise and the buyer
                    makes
                    the brief 'open to all', or invites you to respond to 'open to 1' or 'open to selected'
                    opportunities.<br/>
