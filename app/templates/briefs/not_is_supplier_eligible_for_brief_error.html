        It was published before we completed the transition to the updated Digital Marketplace. And so it's available to our original sellers only.<br/>
        You will be able to apply for opportunities from now on if you have the expertise and the buyer makes the brief 'open to all',
          or includes you on the list of sellers for 'open to 1' or 'open to selected' opportunities.<br/>
        <br/><a href="/{{framework_name}}/opportunities">Back to opportunities</a>
