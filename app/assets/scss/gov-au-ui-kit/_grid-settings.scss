Grid

This framework uses [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) to create a consistent 16 column responsive grid layout with good defaults.

Bourbon is a [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) mixin library (it provides little styling). Neat is a flexible grid framework.

Avoid mixing this layout with other grid layouts.

<p class="callout"><strong>Grid classes?</strong> There are no non-semantic grid classes with which to set block elements. This is intentional. If you need to add to or customise the grid system see below.</p>

Primary content is always contained in 12 columns. This allows for seamless introduction of a sidebar/side navigation.

The grid unit proportions, gutters and spacing are defined in `_grid-settings.scss`.

If you need an element not defined here you are probably not the only one&mdash;please [log a GitHub issue](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues) so we can provide it for everyone.

Responsive breakpoints

This framework has a mobile-first default layout of 4 columns, and adds 3 breakpoints for grid layout on larger screens:

- Default: 4 columns
- Mobile: 8 columns, 420px minimum
- Tablet: 12 columns, 768px minimum
- Desktop: 16 columns, 1200px minimum

If you give an element a modified grid setting consider the implications for all breakpoints. The Digital Service Standard recommends you [build using mobile first design principles](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/6-consistent-and-responsive/).

Please also consider the [font size](section-typography.html#kssref-typography-2-headings-body-copy-1-breakpoints) at different breakpoints.

```
$mobile: new-breakpoint(min-width 420px 8);
$tablet: new-breakpoint(min-width 768px 12);
$desktop: new-breakpoint(min-width $max-width 16);
```

Debugging

Turn on the visual grid to help debugging:
